# HMM for Pathological Gait Analysis - Important Context

## Why the Roth HMM Model Matters

You're absolutely correct - the **Roth HMM model is specifically designed for pathological gait**, particularly:

- **Parkinson's disease** patients with freezing of gait (FOG)
- **Irregular stride patterns** that DTW might miss
- **Variable stride durations** common in movement disorders
- **Unsupervised free-living gait** data (not just lab conditions)

### Key Differences from DTW:

| Feature | DTW (BarthDtw) | HMM (Roth) |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| **Best For** | Regular, healthy gait | **Pathological, irregular gait** |
| **Freezing of Gait** | May miss irregular patterns | ✅ **Designed for FOG detection** |
| **Variable Strides** | Assumes consistent patterns | ✅ **Handles high variability** |
| **Training Data** | Healthy subjects | ✅ **PD patients + healthy subjects** |
| **Publication** | General algorithm | ✅ **JNER 2021 - PD-specific validation** |

## The Research Context

From the Roth et al. (2021) paper in *Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation*:

> "Hidden Markov Model based Stride Segmentation on Unsupervised Free-living Gait Data in Parkinson's Disease Patients"

### Key Findings:
- Trained on **manually segmented strides from PD patients**
- Validated specifically for **irregular gait patterns**
- Handles **stride-to-stride variability** better than template-based methods
- Works on **unsupervised free-living data** (real-world conditions)

### Why This Matters for Your Use Case:

If you're working with:
- Parkinson's disease patients
- Freezing of gait episodes
- Highly variable stride patterns
- Pathological movement patterns
- Real-world (non-lab) gait data

Then **HMM is worth the installation effort** because DTW may:
- Fail to detect irregular strides
- Require too-consistent templates
- Miss freezing episodes
- Not generalize to pathological patterns

## Alternative Approaches While HMM is On Hold

### 1. Use DTW for Initial Analysis
Even though DTW isn't optimized for pathological gait, it can still:
- Detect regular stride segments
- Provide baseline measurements
- Help you understand the data structure
- Validate your data processing pipeline

### 2. Reach Out to Gaitmap Developers
The gaitmap team may have:
- Pre-built Docker containers with working HMM
- Recommendations for installing pomegranate
- Updates on pomegranate compatibility work
- Access to pre-compiled wheels

**Contact**: https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap/issues

### 3. Use gaitmap's Legacy Version
There might be older gaitmap versions with better pomegranate compatibility:

```bash
# Try gaitmap v2.2.0 or v2.3.0 with Python 3.8
python3.8 -m venv venv_legacy
source venv_legacy/bin/activate
pip install gaitmap==2.2.0[hmm]
```

### 4. Manual Stride Detection Post-Processing
You could:
1. Use DTW for initial detection
2. Apply custom rules for irregular patterns
3. Post-process to catch variable strides
4. Validate against clinical markers

## Docker Solution (Most Reliable)

Since this is for pathological gait analysis, investing time in a Docker setup might be worth it:

### Complete Docker Setup:

Create `Dockerfile.hmm`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    python3.8-dev \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app

# Install specific versions that are known to work together
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    numpy==1.21.0 \
    scipy==1.7.0 \
    scikit-learn==0.24.2 \
    Cython==0.29.24 \
    joblib==1.0.1 \
    networkx==2.6 \
    pyyaml==5.4.1

# Install pomegranate
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pomegranate==0.14.3

# Install gaitmap
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    pandas \
    matplotlib \
    jupyter \
    gaitmap==2.3.0

# Verify installation
RUN python -c "from gaitmap.stride_segmentation.hmm import HmmStrideSegmentation; print('HMM import successful')"

EXPOSE 8888

CMD ["jupyter", "notebook", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--port=8888", "--no-browser", "--allow-root"]
```

### Build and Run:

```bash
cd ~/my-project2/GM_CC

# Build the Docker image
docker build -f Dockerfile.hmm -t gaitmap-hmm-pd .

# Run with your data mounted
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app gaitmap-hmm-pd

# Access Jupyter at: http://localhost:8888
```

## Conda/Mamba Alternative

Conda might handle the dependencies better:

```bash
# Install miniconda if not present
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Create environment
conda create -n gaitmap-hmm python=3.8
conda activate gaitmap-hmm

# Install dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge numpy=1.21 scipy scikit-learn cython
pip install pomegranate==0.14.3
pip install gaitmap matplotlib jupyter
```

## When HMM is Critical

Given your use case (Parkinson's/pathological gait), I recommend:

### Priority 1: Docker Setup
- Most reliable for complex dependencies
- Reproducible environment
- Can share with collaborators
- Worth the initial setup time

### Priority 2: Contact Gaitmap Team
- They may have working configurations
- Might provide pre-built containers
- Could prioritize pomegranate update for clinical users
- May have access to compiled wheels

### Priority 3: Use Older Python 3.8
- Less Cython compatibility issues
- Better pomegranate support
- Try: `sudo apt install python3.8 python3.8-dev`

## Future-Proofing

Keep an eye on:

1. **Gaitmap updates**: https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap/releases
2. **Pomegranate migration**: They're working on supporting newer versions
3. **Alternative HMM libraries**: pomegranate-protobuf, hmmlearn (though not compatible)

---

## Summary

For **pathological gait analysis** (Parkinson's, FOG, irregular patterns):
- ✅ HMM (Roth) is **scientifically the right choice**
- ✅ DTW is **not a replacement** for your use case
- ✅ Docker is **the most reliable installation method**
- ✅ Worth investing time to get HMM working properly

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Try Docker approach** (most likely to succeed)
2. **Contact gaitmap developers** for clinical use case support
3. **Use DTW temporarily** for data exploration only
4. **Keep HMM as the target** for production analysis
