# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

How to Instruct Future Sessions
When starting a new Claude Code session, include this in your initial message:

I prefer the "run and report" workflow:
1. Write/modify code as needed
2. Run it in the background (using Bash with run_in_background=true)
3. Monitor output periodically (using BashOutput tool)
4. Report back with actual results and metrics
5. Suggest next steps based on observations

Don't just write code and wait - test it and show me real results!

## Project Overview

This repository appears to be in its initial stages. The directory name suggests it may be related to Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and dependency installation.

## Current State

The repository currently contains minimal files. As the project develops, this document should be updated to reflect:
- Build and test commands
- Code architecture and structure
- Development workflows
- Project-specific conventions
